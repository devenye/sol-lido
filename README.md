'Lido for Solana' is a Lido-DAO governed liquid staking protocol for the Solana blockchain. Anyone who stakes their SOL tokens with Lido will be issued an on-chain representation of SOL staking position with Lido validators, called stSOL.

Lido for Solana gives you:

- Liquidity — No delegation/activation delays and the ability to sell your staked tokens
- One-click staking — No complicated steps
- Decentralized security — Assets spread across the industry’s leading validators chosen by the Lido DAO

This repository contains both the Solana program (./program) and a client (./cli) for interacting with
the program.
